# Tree

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.

## Types of Binary Tree
- Full Binary Tree
- Complete Binary Tree
- Perfect Binary Tree
- Balanced Binary Tree
- Degenerate or Pathological Tree
- Skewed Binary Tree

## Full Binary Tree
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children. It is also known as a proper binary tree.

## Complete Binary Tree
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences
1. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
2. The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

## Perfect Binary Tree
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

## Balanced Binary Tree
A balanced binary tree, also referred to as a height-balanced binary tree, is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1.

Following are the conditions for a height-balanced binary tree:
1. difference between the left and the right subtree for any node is not more than one
2. the left subtree is balanced
3. the right subtree is balanced
