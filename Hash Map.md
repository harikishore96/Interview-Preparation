# Hash Map

### Collision Resolving Techniques,
1. Linear Probing
2. Separate Chaining

### Linear Probing,
Clustering is a serious drawback to linear probing.

### Properties of good Hash Function,
- Makes use of all info provided by key
- Uniformly distributes output across table
- Maps similar keys to very different hash values
- Uses only very fast operations
