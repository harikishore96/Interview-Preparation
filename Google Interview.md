# Google Interview

1) Merge sort can be highly useful
2) Hash tables: You should know this data structure and how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in the space of one interview.
3) Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree - red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree
4) Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
5) Graphs are really important at Google.
6) You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search.
7)  If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*.  
8) You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise.
9) Find out what NP-complete means.  
10) Spend some time on the essentials of combinatorics and probability. 
11) Discrete Math 101 situations.
12) You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk the more the better.

### How to approach a coding problem
1) Analyze the question
2) Find Inputs and Outputs
3) Picturize the input and output
4) Visualize the problem and solution
5) List the test cases
6) Try Brute force approach
7) Optimize the solution
